      <h2>A Classic Italian Baked Dish</h2>

      <p>
        Lasagna is <strong>a classic Italian baked dish</strong> 
        made of stacked layers of wide, flat pasta 
        sheets, alternating with fillings such as 
        ragù (meat sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, 
        and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, 
        and Parmesan. The assembled dish is typically 
        topped with grated cheese and baked until 
        golden and bubbling.
      </p>

      <p>The dish originated in Italy, with early recipes 
        dating back to the 14th century, 
        though they did not resemble the tomato-based 
        version widely known today, as tomatoes were 
        a later addition to Italian cuisine in the 
        16th century. True Italian lasagne is 
        renowned for its regional variations; for 
        instance, the classic Bolognese version 
        features a rich meat sauce and béchamel, 
        while a Genoan variation incorporates pesto. 
        Generally, the dish requires careful layering,
        often starting with sauce on the bottom of 
        the pan to prevent sticking, followed 
        by pasta sheets and fillings, repeated for 
        several layers.
